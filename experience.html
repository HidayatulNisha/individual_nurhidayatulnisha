Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM) is the place where I continued my studies and majored in the Diploma in Information Management. 
Now I am in my last year which is semester 5. Throughout my studies here there are many things I have learned. 
Apart from learning academic knowledge, I also learned a lot about leadership skills and many more. 
One of the experiences I will never forget was being able to meet new friends from various states. 
This was a very valuable experience for me as this was the first time, I was able to make friends with so many people from various states. 
Aside from having a sweet experience, there are also various challenges as a university student. 
One of the most challenging tests for me was being away from my family where I was a child who never lived far away from my family. 
In addition, the main challenge that students have to face as university students is to adapt to the local culture. 
However, in the second semester, in February 2020, students started online learning due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
</p>

<p>
As a student, online learning is difficult as various challenges need to be overcome. 
For example, unstable internet, lack of facilities and some students have problems with family and so on. 
Some students need to work to help family members affected by this pandemic, so they need to divide their time to take online classes and work. 
Therefore, the experience of conducting online learning is not an easy thing especially for students as well as lecturers. 
So far, I am thankful to be able to survive until this last semester with my classmates. 
Too many ups and downs to deal with so far, but that didnâ€™t stop me from continuing this fight until the end. 
As Angelique Kerber said, "You will always have ups and downs in your life and your career, but just stay positive and go for it."
</p>

<p><strong>Here are some tips for online learning that I often do:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Make a to-do list and deadlines for your assignments.</li>
<li>Divide time to study and work.</li>
<li>Communicate regularly for group projects.</li>
<li>Divide the group work at the beginning of the time.</li>
<li>Do not skip class without a good reason.</li>
<li>Be flexible.</li>
</ul>
